# Cup & Handle Signal Fix - Summary

## Problem
The cup & handle signal (and other pattern signals) were not working with the Alpha Research Platform. They were defined in `signals.py` but:
1. **Not registered** in the `SIGNAL_REGISTRY` 
2. **Only computed for the most recent date** instead of all historical dates

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Missing Registration
The pattern signals were defined as classes but never added to `SIGNAL_REGISTRY`, so `get_signal('cup_handle')` returned `None`.

### Issue 2: Single-Point Computation
Pattern signals only returned one signal value per symbol (the most recent date), while technical indicators returned values for all dates. This broke backtesting because:
- Backtesting requires historical signal values to correlate with future returns
- With only one data point per symbol, there's insufficient data for IC calculation

## Solution

### 1. Registered Pattern Signals
Added all 4 pattern signals to `SIGNAL_REGISTRY`:
```python
SIGNAL_REGISTRY = {
    # ... existing signals ...
    'cup_handle': CupAndHandleSignal(),
    'asc_triangle': AscendingTriangleSignal(),
    'bull_flag': BullFlagSignal(),
    'double_bottom': DoubleBottomSignal(),
}
```

### 2. Fixed Computation Logic
Modified each pattern signal to compute values for **every date** with sufficient history:

**Before:**
```python
def compute(self, df_prices, ...):
    # Only computed for last date
    results.append({
        'symbol': symbol,
        'date': df['date'].iloc[-1],  # ❌ Only last date
        'signal_value': score
    })
```

**After:**
```python
def compute(self, df_prices, ...):
    # Compute for all dates with sufficient history
    for i in range(60, len(df)):
        window = df.iloc[:i+1]
        # ... compute score using only data up to date i ...
        results.append({
            'symbol': symbol,
            'date': window['date'].iloc[-1],  # ✅ All dates
            'signal_value': score
        })
```

## Verification

Tested with Docker container:
```bash
docker exec pattern-scanner python -c "from signals import list_signals; ..."
```

**Available signals now include:**
- ✅ cup_handle
- ✅ asc_triangle  
- ✅ bull_flag
- ✅ double_bottom

**Signal computation test:**
- Input: 147 days of AAPL price data
- Output: 87 signal values (one per date after 60-day warmup)
- Status: ✅ Working correctly

## Usage

Now you can backtest pattern signals in the Alpha Research Platform:

1. Go to http://localhost:5002/research
2. Select "cup_handle" (or other pattern signals) from the dropdown
3. Choose symbols and timeframe
4. Run backtest to see IC, hit rate, Sharpe ratio, etc.

## Why Cup & Handle Should Work

The cup & handle pattern is considered reliable because:
- **Defined criteria**: Cup depth 12-33%, handle decline < 15%
- **Volume confirmation**: Increasing volume on breakout
- **Symmetry**: U-shaped cup with balanced left/right sides
- **Consolidation**: Handle shows healthy pullback before breakout

The signal scoring (0-100) captures these characteristics:
- 50 points: Cup depth in optimal range
- 30 points: Handle decline within limits  
- 20 points: Volume surge confirmation

Higher scores indicate stronger pattern formation, which should correlate with positive future returns.

## Next Steps

You can now:
1. Compare cup_handle vs other pattern signals
2. Test on different timeframes and stock universes
3. Combine with technical indicators for composite signals
4. Analyze performance by market regime

The pattern signals are now fully integrated with the backtesting framework!
